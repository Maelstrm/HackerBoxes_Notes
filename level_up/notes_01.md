## Notes

### Power Supply

* ATX Power supply used to provide bench-top power:
  * 12v, 5v, 3.3v
  * Each output has a fuse to prevent overcharge
* Buck Converter
  * Converts voltage down, but not up     

### Logic Gates

 * Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) Devices
   * Usually manufacturers offer logic gates used for creating electronic devices.
 * Buffer Gate:
   * Passes unchanged input.
   * Opposite of NOT gate.
   * Often used to increase propagation delate of circuits.
     * The amount of time it takes for the head of a signal to travel from sender to receiver.
   * Transistor acts as a switch
 * Inverter Gate (NOT):
   * Generates a signal that is logically opposite of its input.
 * OR Gate :
   * Logical disjunction
     * True if one or more operands is true
   * Finds the maximum between 2 binary digits
 * XOR GATE:
   * Exclusive OR gate
   * Only true if the inputs differ.
   * 
 * NOT-OR Gate (NOR):
   * Only high input if both inputs to the gate are low.
   * Can only convert from HIGH to LOW
 * AND Gate:
   * Logical conjunction
     * True only if ALL operands are true 
   * This function can extend to any number of inputs
 * NAND Gate:
   * Not AND
   * False if all inputs are true\
   * Invertsion + OR gate
   * Logically complete
     * Can be used to express all truth tables.
