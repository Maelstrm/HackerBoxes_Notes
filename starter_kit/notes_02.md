## Digital Multimeter

* Typically used to measure:
  * voltage
  * current,
  * resistance

## Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law

* `Electricity` is the movement of electrons.
  * Electrons create **charge**, which is harnessed to do work.
* Basic Principles:
  * **Voltage**, measure of electric potential between 2 points
  * **Current**, the rate at which charge is flowing.
  * **Resistance**, the material's tendency to resist the flow of charge (current)
* A `circuit` is a closed loop that allows charge to move from one place to another.
* **George Ohm**, Bavarian scientist who studied electricity.

### Voltage

* **Atoms**
  * Structure
    * Core
      * `Protons` => Positive charge
      * `Neutrons` => Neutral charge
    * Orbitals
      * `Electrons` => Negative charge
  * The charge of an atom is based on the proportion ratio of Protons to Electrons
* When two objects have different charges there is **static electricity**.
